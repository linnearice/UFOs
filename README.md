# UFO Sightings

## Overview
Dana, a young journalist, is excited to begin covering stories of her own.  Her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon is famous for UFO sightings.  Every year, thousands of visitors flock to McMinnville, a quiet Willamette Valley town located an hour southwest of Portland, to attend the city’s famous UFO Festival. Oregon’s annual celebration features days full of parades, costume contests, expert speakers and family fun.  Dana is hopeful to add to the celebration by offering a way for festival goers to filter through a treasure trove of UFO sightings data that she has access to.  Dana has a large javascript data file full of information on actual UFO sightings.  It is Dana's vision to provide users access to an HTML website where they can peruse through the data by filtering for information by location (city, state and or country).  There is also really cool information on the shape of the UFO sighting as well as how long the sighting lasted and a description of the sighting.  Dana is very excited about this project. 

## Results
To bring Dana's vision to life, Dana has reviewed the data available in her javascript file.  The file has individual inforamtion of UFO sightings over several years all over the world.  Each UFO sighting offers valuable inforamtion as follows:
* the date of the sighting
* city
* state
* country
* shape of the item seen
* duration of the sighting
* comments describing the sighting

Dana will design a javascript program to go through the data and she will develop an HTML file that will present the data in a festive and user friendly fashion.  Users will be able to filter sightings based on:
* date
* city
* state
* country
* shape

The data unfiltered is presented above.  However, if a user wants to see only those UFO sightings in California, for example, a user can go on to the HTML and in the state filter box enter "ca" and hit the filter button and the list will provide only those sightings located in California as shown below:

## Summary
Dana is excited about the results of her work and will hopefully have a booth where she can provide a computer for visitors to search live in her space and then share the HTML link for them to use on their own.  

Drawback:
Dana was disappointed however, not to be able to include the 2 other data points (duration and comments) in the filtered searches as well.  Upon review of the database this data did not prove to be as descriptive or as reliable as hoped.  Therefore Dana did not include this data in the filtered searches. 

Additional recommendations:
What would really bring the UFO sightings to life would be photos of the actual sightings if available.  What might be a lifelong project would be to research records to find the actual sightings in newspaper clippings etc.  Many of these sightings are documented with acual photos and these can be added to the data findings.

Also, when researching the findings any sources of information such as newspaper articles, etc. can be added to the data as user "links" to more information.  This would be another way to bring these sightings to life for those interested.
